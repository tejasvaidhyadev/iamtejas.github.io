## üé• **Filmmaking & Animation**

I make films covering a variety of topics. I developed a short film to avoid deforestation and placed second in the General Championship at IIT Kharagpur. I also try to simulate virtual Varanasi.

## **Architecture?**
Architecture is a love-hate relationship for me. Architecture, in my opinion, is a field that, at its core, is as bizarre as poetry or music, but has been relegated to the status of real estate make-up. I have no plans to pursue the field in the manner it is now practised, but I do see the importance of architectural design practise in all of my works. For my undergrad thesis (to be completed by July 2022), I am designing the 'Incubator center of indian startup in AI' that will encapsulate everything I've learned so far.

**Previous work**  
I've worked on a lot of studio design projects in the past.¬†You can find some of my project in the link below
